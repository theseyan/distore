    <h1>Distore</h1>
    <i>Fast, unlimited, encrypted storage on Discord!</i>
</p>

# Get Started
Install with npm:
```
npm i distore
```

# Why?
- Discord has no limits on file storage in a server
- Bypasses 25MiB file size limit by splitting files into chunks
- End-to-end encryption using 256 bit AES-GCM (Discord does **not** use E2EE)
- Guarantees file integrity and no tampering
- Parallely uploads/downloads chunks for maximising bandwidth
